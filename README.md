# spr5-kdm1a-conservation-
Bioinformatics project comparing SPR-5 and KDM1A domain conservation and variants
This repository contains all code, data, analyses, and Ai usage documentation for a bioinformatics project investigating the evolutionary conservation of SPR-5 (C. elegans) and KDM1A (human). The goal is to determine whether C. elegans is a valid model organism for studying KDM1A-linked fertility defects.
