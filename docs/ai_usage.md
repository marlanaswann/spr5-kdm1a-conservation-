Tool/model & version: Chat-GPT 5 mini
What I asked for: Help me set up code to run RBH for SPR-5 and KDM1A to confirm orthology
What I changed before committing: I added extra sections of code to uncompress the large proteome files because the BLAST databases would not work due to the code still being compressed.
How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I used commands  !head -n 5 humanproteome.fasta and
!head -n 5 celegansproteome.fasta to view file format before creating databases.
